## Pages and Interactions

### `index.html` (Login Page)

1. **User Login**: Allows users to enter their credentials and select their role (student, teacher, staff, or admin).
2. **Navigation**: On successful login, users are directed to their respective dashboard pages (`grievances.html` for users, `dashboard.html` for admin).

### `dashboard.html` (Admin Dashboard)

1. **View Grievances**: Admins can see a list of all grievances filed by users.
2. **Approve/Delete Grievances**: Admins can approve or delete grievances, updating the status in the system.
3. **Profile Management**: Admins can navigate to view or update profiles of students, teachers, or staff.

### `profile.html` (Profile Page)

1. **View Profile Information**: Users can view their personal profile information.
2. **Edit Profile**: Users can update their contact information. On submission, updates are reflected in LocalStorage or sent to the backend API if configured.
3. **Save Changes**: The form allows users to save profile changes, which updates the relevant section in the LocalStorage (or backend if API is connected).

### `grievances.html` (Grievance Management Page)

1. **File a Grievance**: Users can submit a grievance with details, which will be saved to LocalStorage or posted to the API.
2. **View Filed Grievances**: Displays a list of filed grievances categorized by status (Pending, Approved, Resolved).
3. **Edit/Delete Grievance**: Users can edit or delete their grievances before they are approved by admin.

## API Calls and Data Handling

The project uses LocalStorage for storing temporary data in development. In a production setup, API endpoints are utilized for CRUD operations. The API URLs should be configured in the `api.js` file.

### Example API Endpoints (Defined in `api.js`)

- **Login**: `POST /api/login` â€” Validates user credentials and returns session details.
- **Get Grievances**: `GET /api/grievances` â€” Retrieves all grievances.
- **File a Grievance**: `POST /api/grievances` â€” Submits a new grievance.
- **Update Grievance**: `PUT /api/grievances/:id` â€” Updates a grievance by ID.
- **Delete Grievance**: `DELETE /api/grievances/:id` â€” Deletes a grievance by ID.
- **Update Profile**: `PUT /api/users/:id/profile` â€” Updates user profile information.

Ensure to replace placeholders with actual API URLs in the `api.js` file.

### Interaction between Pages and API Calls

1. **User Login** (`index.html`)
   - Calls `POST /api/login` to authenticate users.
   - On success, redirects to the respective page based on user type.

2. **File and Manage Grievances** (`grievances.html`)
   - Calls `POST /api/grievances` when filing a new grievance.
   - Fetches data using `GET /api/grievances` to display user-specific grievances.
   - Allows users to update or delete grievances via `PUT` and `DELETE` methods.

3. **Admin Dashboard** (`dashboard.html`)
   - Loads all grievances using `GET /api/grievances`.
   - Approves grievances via `PUT /api/grievances/:id`.
   - Deletes grievances via `DELETE /api/grievances/:id`.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Ensure the browser supports LocalStorage for data handling.
4. (Optional) Configure the backend API endpoints in `api.js` for full functionality.
